[Diego](/consortium/diego), [Arnaud](/consortium/arnaud), [Cedric](/consortium/cedric) and  [Maria](/consortium/maria)
are waiting for your contributions at [3ECEES](https://3ecees.ro/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/S10_Recent-advances-in-Archeoseismology-historical-monuments.pdf).

We invite contributions from disciplines spanning from history to earthquake engineering and seismology. Among the proposed topics, we find: historical/archaeological works on the impact of past earthquakes on structure and society, evolution of building history and their vulnerability through the centuries, petrological/mineralogical characterization of (ancient) building materials, architectural and structural engineering analysis, modelling masonry behavior under seismic loading, and ground motion seismology including site effects and soil- structure interaction in archaeological sites. Experimental, analytical, and numerical modelling approaches are naturally expected. Running case-studies and/or foreseen archaeological sites are also welcome.
