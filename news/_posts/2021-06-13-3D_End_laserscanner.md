This week Andrea Arrighetti and the [SISMA](http://www.sisma2015.it){:target="_blank"} team visited San Giovanni Maggiore and San Lorenzo in Borgo churches.
The 3D laser scanner survey is at its final stage, now is time to move towards the ambient vibration records!

Thanks guys for your work, we look forward for amazing 3D images!
