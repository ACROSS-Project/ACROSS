Diego Mercerat, Philippe Langlaude and Arnaud Montabert are in Mugello to record the ambient vibration noise in the bell towers. This datum will be used to perform operational vibration analysis to empirically retrieve the structure modal basis.
Yesterday the team mesured 24 points in the tiny Ronta bell tower under the benevolent gaze of the parish priest!
