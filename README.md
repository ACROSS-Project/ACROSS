# ACROSS

ACROSS stands for "ArChaeology, inventory of RecOnstruction, Seismology and Structural engineering".

The project goal is to demonstrate that archaeological characterization of post-seismic repairs on buildings can be successfully used to infer key ground motion and earthquake source characteristics of historical earthquakes.

The project is founded by the Agence Nationale de la recherche [ANR-20-CE03-0003](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-20-CE03-0003){:target="_blank"}.
