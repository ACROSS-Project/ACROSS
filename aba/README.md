# ACROSS before ACROSS

Before ACROSS the consortium started a collaboration, in the framework of a Arnaud Montabert PhD thesis, to study Sant’Agata del Mugello, a medieval church located in the Mugello basin in central Apennines (Italy), an exceptional site under many points of view. Since the XI century, Mugello occupies a strategic position connecting Florence and the Po Plain; hence it developed a strong link with the city of Florence lasting until Italian unification. The region boasts homogeneity of historical archives over seven centuries (1200-1900). Its valuable cultural heritage is characterized by medieval buildings, that have been restored and preserved through the centuries; nowadays they are the object of petrographic and mechanical analyses aimed at their characterization and preservation.
