# Job Offers

**18 Month Post doctoral position in IRSN France**

**Duration**: 18 months

**Starting date**: Flexible, between October 2021 and March 2022

**Location**: Paris, France

**Pre-requisites**: PhD - experience in numerical simulations of wave propagation or rupture dynamics in 3D models

**Our offer**: Opportunity to model the seismic ground motion taking into account source rupture complexity and wave propagation in a 3D sedimentary basin. True integration of the ground motion models in a knowledge chain spanning between geology (build 3D model from inputs) and the damaged structures (outputs will be used to shake numerical models of historical buildings). Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team (historians, archeologists, petrologists, civil engineers, geologists, seismologists, mathematicians) from Italy and France. Learn to solve complex problems using high performance computing facilities.

**Title**: Modelling seismic ground motion including source and site complexity for better knowledge of past earthquakes (Funding by the French national research agency, ANR)
