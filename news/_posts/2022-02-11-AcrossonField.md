  Installing broadband stations in Mugello
---


[Celine](/consortium/celine) and [SÃ©bastien](/consortium/seb) are now in Mugello, their mission? Installing broad band stations to record earthquakes at regional and teleseismic distances to empirically measure the basin response. 

How? The idea is to perform spectral ratio of signals recorded on rock site and in sites located over the basin.
